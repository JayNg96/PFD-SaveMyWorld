                    <h2 class="section-heading">What is Biodiversity Loss?</h2>
                    <p>Biodiversity loss refers to the decline or disappearance of biological diversity, understood as the variety of living things that inhabit the planet, its different levels of biological organisation and their respective genetic variability, as well as the natural patterns present in ecosystems. In mid-2019, the United Nations (UN), in collaboration with IPBES, presented an ambitious report [PDF]External link, opens in new window. on biodiversity warning that out of a total of eight million, one million species are in danger of extinction. Some researchers even dared to talk about the sixth mass extinction in the history of the planet.</p>
                    <p>Biodiversity loss has many consequences, not only for the environment, but also for human beings at the economic and health level. During the presentation of the IPBES report, David Cooper, the Deputy Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity, took the opportunity to warn about this in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis: "As we degrade ecosystems, the risk of future pandemics increases."</p>

                    <p>Biodiversity has suffered everywhere we've gone since the first Homo sapiens. It has now evolved into one of our most serious environmental issues, with animal populations in danger.</p>
                    <p>The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) released the 2020 Living Planet Report, which compiled information on biodiversity population declines around the world. Globally, all monitored populations have decreased by an average of 68 percent since 1975, but some regions have fared far worse. Countries such as Latin America and the Caribbean saw a 94 percent decline during the same time period.</p>
                    <p>The primary cause of global decline is land-use change, which occurs when people convert habitats such as forests, mangroves, or grasslands into agricultural systems. In fact, some scientists believe we are living through the sixth mass extinction.</p>

                    <p>The changes in the amazon rainforest have accurately depicted how human activity and lack of enforcement has caused irreversible damage to the once diverse biodiversity. As industrial agriculture, mining and logging have barreled across the Amazon rainforest in recent decades, fires and deforestation have dramatically reduced the habitat of tens of thousands of plant and animal species, damaging not just the rainforest’s ability to act as a climate stabilizer but its role as the world’s greatest reservoir of biodiversity. Nearly 4,000 square miles of forest have been damaged since 2019, the authors noted, “leading to some of the most severe potential impacts on biodiversity since 2009.” </p>
                    <p>Although goals and plans like the Aichi Target, a set of 20 targets to slow down the destruction of the planet's biodiversity that was meant to be achieved in 2020 have been set, the progress is slow and the fulfilment of these goals still seems far away. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Indirect Causes</h2>
                    <p>Not only is the loss of biodiversity caused through direct attacks on the ecosystems, but changes to the environment such as climate change, light pollution and noise pollution can affect biodiversity as well. Changes in global temperature due to climate change result in diminishing ice packs which are habitats of polar bears, penguins and other arctic animals. As the ice melts, it increases the sea level, which will affect and perhaps destroy ecosystems on coastlines. Changes in temperatures will also cause shifts in mating cycles, especially for migratory animals that rely on changing seasons to indicate their migration and reproductive timing. </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, noise and light pollution disrupts the natural patterns of wildlife. Studies have shown that loud noises cause caterpillars’ hearts to beat faster and bluebirds to have fewer chicks. Animals use sound for a variety of reasons, including to navigate, find food, attract mates, and avoid predators. Noise pollution makes it difficult for them to accomplish these tasks, which affects their ability to survive. In another study, light pollution has been determined as another driver of insect decline. Insects are drawn from their usual activities towards artificial lights and thus, breeding is not as efficient as before which could lead to a drop in insect numbers which are also an important food source to other animals. </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">How does it affect us?</h2>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What can we do?</h2>
                    <p>Individuals can help save our biodiversity by supporting large initiatives such as 30 by 30, in which world leaders have pledged to protect 30% of land and ocean by 2030, and we can support these by electing representatives who support the movement.</p>
